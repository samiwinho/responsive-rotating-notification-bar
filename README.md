This pen demonstrates a continuous rotating text banner that alternates between multiple short messages.
It features:

- Smooth fade-in/fade-out animation and horizontal scroll when text exceeds container width.
- Responsive and accessible structure (aria-live for assistive technologies).
- “Close” button with persistent state using sessionStorage.
- Pure Vanilla JS (no dependencies).
- Language-based message setup (auto-adjusts text based on <html lang>).

Perfect for top-of-page announcements, promotions, or newsletter invites.
You can easily adapt it for different use cases by modifying the message content or rotation timing.
